# nvim-config

Configuration for neovim.  This is a work in progress setup forked from (Fedora magazine)[https://fedoramagazine.org/configuring-neovim-on-fedora-as-an-ide-and-using-lazyvim/] using `lazy.vim`.  

To install, clone repo and symlink to `$HOME/.config/nvim`. Open neovim and run `:Lazy install`. Check the status of plugins with `:checkhealth` to see what dependencies, etc. you may be missing.
